## Reduce Warehouse Space with the Pareto Principle using Python 📦
*How the 80/20 rule implemented using python can optimize your layout, reduce space utilization and improve the picking productivity*

An Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto developed 1906 a mathematical formula to describe the distribution of wealth in Italy. He discovered that 80% of the wealth belonged to 20% of the population.

A few decades later this rule has been generalized to many other applications including Supply Chain and Logistics Management.
This principle called the “Pareto Principle”, “the 80–20 rule” or “The Law of Trivial Many and Critical Few” can be translated for Logistics Practitioners
- 80% of your company revenue is made from 20% of your reference
- 80% of your volume is picked in 20% of your picking locations
- 80% of your replenishment volume will be performed on 20% of your picking locations
